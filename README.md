# 
**CONTROLS**

- **Hand movements**: Use hand by rotate the wrist to change the direction of Pacman. Where the fingers point is direction of Pacman.

- **Pellets**: Small dots scattered throughout the maze. Eating all pellets in a level allows you to progress to the next level.
- **Power Pellets**: Larger dots that give Pacman the temporary ability to eat ghosts.
- **Ghosts**: Enemies that roam the maze. If a ghost catches Pacman, you lose a life. After losing all lives, the game is over.

### GHOST BEHAVIOR
- **Chase Mode**: Ghosts actively chase Pacman.
- **Scatter Mode**: Ghosts move to their respective corners of the maze.

### SCORING
- **Pellet**: 10 points each.
- **Power Pellet**: 50 points each.
- **Ghost**: Points for eating ghosts increase with each successive ghost eaten in a single power pellet duration (200, 400, 800, 1600 points).
- **Fruit**: Points vary depending on the type of fruit.

### LEVELS
Each level increases in difficulty with faster ghosts and more complex maze layouts. The game continues until all lives are lost.
